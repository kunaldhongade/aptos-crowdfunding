# üöÄ Crowdfunding Platform - Frontend

Welcome to the **Crowdfunding Platform** frontend, a decentralized application built on the **Aptos Blockchain**. This platform empowers project creators to raise funds transparently, while backers can contribute Aptos tokens (**APT**) directly to support innovative ideas. All operations, from project creation to fund management, are handled seamlessly through smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Move to Folder

```bash
cd crowdfunding-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:

```bash
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x17c2ceb4f5f7069a4c48dccd7405895dd8ef5d7660b8e77d9d16176b5a6b90f6
```

Update the **module address** if you deploy your contract to a new address.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    sys_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "17c2ceb4f5f7069a4c48dccd7405895dd8ef5d7660b8e77d9d16176b5a6b90f6"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init
    ```

4.  Compile and publish the contract:

    ```bash
    aptos move compile
    aptos move publish
    ```

## üåê Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Wallet Connection Errors**: Ensure that the wallet extension is installed and active.
2. **RPC Rate Limits**: Use **private RPC nodes** to avoid request limits on public RPCs.
3. **Transaction Failures**: Verify that the wallet has sufficient balance and correct permissions.

---

## üöÄ Scaling and Deployment

If deploying to **Vercel**, you might encounter **RPC request limits**. Consider these solutions:

- Use **third-party RPC providers** like **Alchemy** or **QuickNode**.
- Implement **request throttling** to reduce RPC load.
- Use **WebSockets** for real-time updates.
